; This skeleton of an assembly-language program is provided to help you
; begin with the programming task for A#1, part (a). In this and other
; files provided through the semester, you will see lines of code
; indicating "DO NOT TOUCH" sections. You are *not* to modify the
; lines within these sections. The only exceptions are for specific
; changes announced on conneX or in written permission from the course
; instructor. *** Unapproved changes could result in incorrect code
; execution during assignment evaluation, along with an assignment grade
; of zero. ****
;
; In a more positive vein, you are expected to place your code with the
; area marked "STUDENT CODE" sections.

; ==== BEGINNING OF "DO NOT TOUCH" SECTION ====
;
; Your task: To compute the edit distance between two byte values,
; one in R16, the other in R17. If the first byte is:
;    0b10101111
; and the second byte is:
;    0b10011010
; then the edit distance -- that is, the number of corresponding
; bits whose values are not equal -- would be 4 (i.e., here bits 5, 4,
; 2 and 0 are different, where bit 0 is the least-significant bit).
; 
; Your solution must, of course, work for other values than those
; provided in the example above.
;
; In your code, store the computed edit distance value in R25.
;
; Your solution is free to modify the original values in R16
; and R17.
;
; ANY SIGNIFICANT IDEAS YOU FIND ON THE WEB THAT HAVE HELPED
; YOU DEVELOP YOUR SOLUTION MUST BE CITED AS A COMMENT (THAT
; IS, WHAT THE IDEA IS, PLUS THE URL).

	; Your solution in here.

	ldi r25, 0x00  ; Initializing edit distance value
    ldi r18, 0x00  ; Initialize register R18 to store our XOR result
    
    ; Calculate XOR of R16 and R17 and store result in R18
    eor r18, r16
    eor r18, r17
    
    ; Initialize loop counter R19 to 8 (as we need to check all 8 bits)
    ldi r19, 0x08

check_bit:
    ; Shift right R18. The least significant bit will move to the carry flag (C flag).
    lsr r18
    
    ; If the carry flag is set to 1, add 1 to R25.
    adc r25, r0
    
    ; minus 1 from R19 and check if it has reached zero.
    dec r19
    brne check_bit  ; If R19 is non-zero, loop back to check_bit.

; At this point, R25 should contain the edit distance value.
