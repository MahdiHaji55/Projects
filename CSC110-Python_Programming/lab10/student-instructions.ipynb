    "The concept of an **object-oriented class** was already introduced in lectures. Although it may look like the most complicated thing we have seen so far, it really does build upon much of what you have learned and adds a new mechanism to help with writing more powerful Python programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this kind of programming can seem so strange at first, we often try to provide students with mental models that relate their understanding of the real world, with its objects and the properties of the objects, with examples in code. We will be no different in this course, but please do understand it can be easy to quibble with our examples! The goal here is to help your learn something in Python, and not to argue about [epistemology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology) or [ontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology) (as fun as that might seem).\n",
    "\n",
    "And one last comment before we get started: The class mechanism in Python exposes quite a bit of \"machinery\" to the programmer in a way that languages such as Java or Javascript or C++ do not. Therefore some of the notation you will learn might seem fiddly and fussy at first, but you soon get used to it as that notation also happens to be consistent."
