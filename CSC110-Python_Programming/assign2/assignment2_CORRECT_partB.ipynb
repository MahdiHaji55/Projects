    "Many investment instruments provided by banks, such as Guaranteed Investment Certificates (GICs) pay interest not only on the initial investment (the *principal*) but also on the interest that accumulates over time (*compound* interest).\n",
    "\n",
    "Investment advisors normally discuss options with the clients by focusing on the two following points:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Purchase a GIC at a specific interest rate**; and then\n",
    "1. **Let their GIC earn compound interest for a certain number of years.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for calculating the balance of such an investment after a specified number of years is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$A = P (1 + \\frac{r}{n})^{nt}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $A$ is the amount of money in the account after the specific number of years.\n",
    "* $P$ is the amount deposited into the account.\n",
    "* $r$ is the **annual** interest rate.\n",
    "* $n$ is the number of times per year that the interest is compounded\n",
    "* $t$ is the specific number of years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming that $n = 12$ (as this would represent an investment compounded monthly) then $P$ would be the amount contributed to the investment each month.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are to apply the above formula in order to compute the value of an RESP (Registered Education Savings Plan) for little Tanya assuming her parents invest in GICs as described above. An RESP is used to defer tax on interest, and hence is attractive for those trying to save for their children's post-secondary education.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the age of the child at the start of the RESP, the monthly amount to be saved, and the annual rate of return of the investment, your program is to calculate the total amount of the RESP when the child reaches the age of 18. More precisely, you are now print a table showing the value of the RESP at the end of each year for which funds were saved in the RESP. That is, after asking for:\n",
    "* age of child at the start of the RESP\n",
    "* monthly contribution amount\n",
    "* annual rate of return of investment in percent\n",
    "your program will print a table for each year from the start of the RESP up to and including 18. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for a child's RESP starting at **two years of age**, monthly contribution of **\\$250** (i.e. the parents purchase an additional \\$250 GIC each month), and an annual rate of return of **8%**, the following table would be generated by your program.\n",
