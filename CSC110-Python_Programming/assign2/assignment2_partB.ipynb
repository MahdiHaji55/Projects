    "In this part you will re-use that calculation, but now print a table showing the value of the RESP at the end of each year for which funds were saved in the RESP. That is, after asking for:\n",

    "* monthly contribution amount\n",
    "* annual rate of return of investment in percent\n",
    "your program will print a table for each year from the start of the RESP up to and including 18. \n",
    "\n",
