    "### Part B: Monthly payment for a mortgage\n",
    "\n",
    "Many mortgage instruments provided by banks and credit unions use standard formulas that compute the monthly payments for some loan amount provided to the customer where the loan as a specific length (i.e., the *term*) and for a specific annual interest rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us suppose you have been asked by Sudev, your friend working at the Joyous Programmers Trust Company (JPTC) to help clients calculate monthly payments required for mortages at different interest rates and different terms. (More precisely, what is needed here is to determine the *fixed monthly payment required to fully amortize a loan*.)\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, Sudev's clients are interested in the monthly mortgage payment $P$ that would result for a mortage where:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $L$ is the amount of the mortgage loan in *dollars*;\n",
    "1. $n$ is the *term* of the mortgage loan expressed in *number of months*; and\n",
    "1. $c$ is the *monthly interest rate* (i.e. if the quoted rate is 6%, then the monthly interest rate would be `0.06/12` or `0.005`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard formula for $P$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P = L[c(1 + c)^n] / [(1 + c)^n - 1]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a program that performs the calculation of $P$ for you. The program should ask the user to input the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The amount of original mortage loan\n",
    "1. The annual interest rate offered for the mortage\n",
    "1. The length of the mortgage term in months\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the input data has been entered, the program must calculate and display the monthly payment. Your solution **must not** implement the formula in a single statement; rather, compute intermediate expressions which make sense given the original formula's construction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The user must enter the interest rate as a percentage, but without the '%' sign. That is, 6% would be entered as 6 and not as 0.06. Therefore your program will have to divide the input by 100 to move the decimal point to the correct position.** The value that is output must be printed with two decimal points; during lectures I have already given some descriptions of how output can be formatted in this way.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you would like to check your work, either use a scientific calculator or use this on line tool: `https://www.calculator.net/payment-calculator.html`\n"
