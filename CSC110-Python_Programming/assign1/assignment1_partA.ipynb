    "In this fanciful exercise, you are part of an archaelogical team that is working some fictional location in the west of Ireland. The team has been asked to survey the ruin of church named Cillaspugelmo (\"Church of Bishop Elmo\"). You have been given a diagram showing the layout of perimeter of the original building that corresponds to the complex:\n",
