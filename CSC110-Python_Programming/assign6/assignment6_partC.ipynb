    "This is the third part (part A) of a three-part assignment. The first part (part A) is in the file named ```assignment6_partA.ipynb```, and the second part (part B) is in the file named ```assignment6_partB.ipynb```.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you will write some Python statements within this Jupyter Notebook that are answers to the posed programming questions. By saving what you have written into the notebook, and submitting the resulting notebook as instructed, the teaching team will be able to evaluate your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are encouraged to create your own extra notebooks in order to experiment with programming ideas. Once you have solutions that you wish to submit, these can be copy-and-pasted **into this notebook and in the code cell required**. You should, however, always ensure your Python statements do work by evaluating them within this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "<mark> Submitting new notebooks will **not** be accepted. You must submit this notebook with your answers. \n",
    "\n",
    "**You must not change the name of this notebook file!!**\n",

    "### Food consumption\n",
    "\n",
    "<mark>**Note: This part of the assignment does not require classes. Rather, it is focused on giving you practice using dictionaries and sets.**</mark>\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task in this last part of the assignment is to analyze the data on food-consumption behavior. **Several `CSV` files are provided with this assignment** that contain data regarding which organisms eat which foods (with \"foods\" here possibly other organisms). The data itself is not rigorously scientific (!!) but rather is structured in a such a way as to give you practice working with Python programs using dictionaries and sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "All provided data files use a comma-separated format (*i.e.*, what we expect within a `CSV` file). Each line in the file contains data about the eating habits of an organism and is provided in this format:\n",
    "\n",
    "```<eater>,<eaten 1>,<eaten 2>, ...,<eaten n>```\n",
    "    \n",
    "For example, the third line in ```food01.csv``` is:\n",
    "\n",
    "`jackal,grass,zebra,gazelle`\n",
    "\n",
    "which means that `jackals` eat `grass`, `zebra`s, and `gazelle`s. The last line in `food01.csv` is:\n",
    "\n",
    "`zebra,grass`\n",
    "\n",
    "which means that `zebra`s eat only grass.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `main` function (provided to you) of the program prompts the user for the name of a data file and will read the contents of that data file. Your program will then create variables in a form suitable for computing the answer to some questions. Below is a transcript of one execution of a completed program:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Name of CSV file? food01.csv\n",
    "gazelle: acacia leaves, grass\n",
    "jackal: gazelle, grass, zebra\n",
    "lion: gazelle\n",
    "zebra: grass\n",
    "\n",
    "Only eaters: jackal, lion\n",
    "\n",
    "Only eaten: acacia leaves, grass\n",
    "\n",
    "Fussiest eaters: lion, zebra\n",
    "\n",
    "Tastiest entry: grass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The functions listed in the remainder of this assignment description are best completed in their order of appearance. Your solutions for these must all appear in the single code cell below.\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "#### Functions 1 & 2:  `read_food_file(filename)` and `dump_data(eat_data)`\n",
    "\n",
    "The first function `read_food_file` will open the file corresponding to the filename provided and create a dictionary of lists. That is, each entry in the dictionary will have as its key an eater (*i.e.*, first item in a line) and as a value all of the things which that eater will eat (i.e., second and following items in a line).\n",
    "\n",
    "All items in a line are separated by commas (as we would expected with a `CSV` file) and you can assume all files provided are in the correct format (*i.e.*, you do not need to write error-checking code for input). However, you should print out an error message if the file corresponding to the filename doesnâ€™t exist, afterwards returning an empty dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second function `dump_data` will print a readable version of the data constructed by the first function. Also note the eaters are printed in sorted order (i.e., alphabetical), and within each line the eaten are also printed in sorted order. For example, the output expected from this function given `food01.csv` is seen below. In this output, note the use of colons, commas, spaces, and the alphabetical order of eaters and eaten:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "gazelle: acacia leaves, grass\n",
    "jackal: gazelle, grass, zebra\n",
    "lion: gazelle\n",
    "zebra: grass\n",
    "```\n",
    "----\n",
    "#### Function 3:  `compute_only_eaters(eat_data)`\n",
    "\n",
    "This third function uses the dictionary constructed by `read_food_file` and computes the eaters *who are also not eaten*. Once this is computed, these eaters are returned in a list in alphabetical order. For example, the output expected from this function given `food01.csv` is used by the `main` function to produce this output line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Only eaters: jackal, lion\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "#### Function 4:  `compute_only_eaten(eat_data)`\n",
    "\n",
    "This fourth function uses the dictionary constructed by `read_food_file` and computes all which is eaten but which is not also an eater. (Hint: Something which is eaten but is not an eater will have no key in the dictionary.) Once computed the only-eaten items are returned in a list in alphabetical order. For example, the output expected from this function given `food01.csv` is used by the `main` function to produce this output line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Only eaten: acacia leaves, grass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "#### Function 5:  `compute_fussiest_eaters(eat_data)`\n",
    "\n",
    "This fifth function uses the dictionary constructed by `read_food_file` and looks again at all of the eaters. However, the function will determine the eaters having the *fewest number of items eaten*. (Hint: You will want to compute the minimum of the eaten-item list lengths.) Once this is computed, the fussiest eaters are returned in a list in alphabetical order. For example, the output expected from this function given `food01.csv` is used by the `main` function to produce this output line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Fussiest eaters: lion, zebra\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "#### Function 5:  `compute_most_delicious(eat_data)`\n",
    "\n",
    "This last function uses the dictionary constructed by `read_food_file` and looks again at all of the eaten. However, the function will determine which, of those that are eaten, *have the largest number of eaters*. (Hint: You may want to compute a local dictionary where each of the eaten is a key and the corresponding value is a list of those that eat the eaten.) Once computed, the most delicious of the eaten is returned in a list in alphabetical order. For example, the output expected from this function given `food01.csv` is used by the `main` function to produce this output line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
