    "In this assignment you will write some Python statements within this Jupyter Notebook that are answers to the posed programming questions. By saving what you have written into the notebook, and submitting the resulting notebook as instructed, the teaching team will be able to evaluate your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are encouraged to create your own extra notebooks in order to experiment with programming ideas. Once you have solutions that you wish to submit, these can be copy-and-pasted **into this notebook and in the code cell required**. You should, however, always ensure your Python statements do work by evaluating them within this notebook.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz \"\n",

    "```\n",
    "\"izg jcdlfxomvkwqnyateuhpbsr\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A **simple substitution cipher** is one which takes each letter of a **plaintext** message and converts it into its **ciphertext**. For example, the plaintext message:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"hello\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "becomes the following as ciphertext:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"ljmmw\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If we place the alphabets one above the other, you can see how the `h` becomes `l`, `e` becomes `j`, `l` becomes `m`, and `o` becomes `w`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "plaintext alphabet:  \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz \"\n",
    "ciphertext alphabet: \"izg jcdlfxomvkwqnyateuhpbsr\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You are to write a class named `SimpleCipher` that:\n",
    "* Takes a plaintext alphabet and a ciphertext alphabet as arguments in the constructor.\n",
    "* Implements a method called `encipher` which takes a plaintext string and returns its ciphertext equivalent.\n",
    "* Implements a method called `decipher` which takes a ciphertext string and returns its plaintext equivalent.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code cell provided to you, there is a `main` function which creates several different instances of `SimpleCipher` and uses them to encipher and decipher a few different strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that **all** of the code you must write for this part must be located with the class (i.e. no functions outside of the class are permitted)."
