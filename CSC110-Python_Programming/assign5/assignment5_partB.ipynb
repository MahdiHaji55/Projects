    "In this assignment you will write some Python statements within this Jupyter Notebook that are answers to the posed programming questions. By saving what you have written into the notebook, and submitting the resulting notebook as instructed, the teaching team will be able to evaluate your work.\n",

    "You are encouraged to create your own extra notebooks in order to experiment with programming ideas. Once you have solutions that you wish to submit, these can be copy-and-pasted **into this notebook and in the code cell required**. You should, however, always ensure your Python statements do work by evaluating them within this notebook.\n",

    "### Computing summary stock-price data, now with CSV files\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part of this assignment presented to you some cleaned-up data extracted from CSV files. You then transformed this data in order to compute stock-data statistics for a single stock and a single month. In this part of the assignment you will utilize file-input operations to retrieve data stored in CSV files themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have been given a subdirectory named `price-data/` containing six different CSV files, each containing one year's worth of stock-trading data for a particular company. ***CSV files are really just text files and therefore all routines used to read from a text file can be used with CSV files.*** \n",
    "\n",
    "You are to complete a function named ```compute_all_month_stats()``` that takes a single parameter (corresponding to the name of a file) and returns a list of tuples, one tuple per month of stock-trading statistics based on the contents of the file. The ```main()``` function provided will obtain a filename from the user and call your function with the filename as a parameter. ***If that file exists*** your function will return the computed list of tuples and the ```main()``` function (already provided) will print out that list’s contents. ***If that file does not exist*** then your function will output an error message and return ```None``` instead of a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the user provides ```BCE.csv``` when prompted, the program will call ```compute_all_month_stats()``` with that string as a parameter. This function will compute for each month the statistics as described in part A, and the tuple for each month will have the format described in part A. Therefore given our example, the data returned from the function (*i.e.*, 12 tuples) will result in ```main()``` producing this output:\n",

    "\n",
    "As a second example, if the user provides `not_a_file.csv` when prompted, then the program will call `compute_all_month_stats()` with that string as a parameter. As no such file exists, the function will return `None` and `main()` will cause nothing to be output.\n",
    "\n",
    "***You are welcome – and encouraged! – to use your code from part A to help construct your solution to this part B. However, you are not required to do so.***\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "And here are some additional important notes:\n",
    "1. All CSV files are contained in the subdirectory named `price-data/`.\n",
    "1. The first line of each CSV file does not contain measurement data but rather a description of the data fields contained in each line. The data fields you will need for this part are: `Year`, `Month`, `Day`, `Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Close`, and `Volume`. You should read this first line from the file, but you need not do anything with it (i.e., the value returned from a call to ```readline()``` may be safely ignored). Also you may manually count the position of each field in the line, and hardcode those numbers in your solution (*e.g.*, `4` for `High`). ***You may assume that all files have the same number and order of data fields.***\n",
    "1. Please remember that strings are not integers or floats. You may need to call `int()`, `float()`, and `str()` when and where appropriate.\n",
    "1. The expected output for each of the provided CSV files is contained in a filename with a similar prefix but using `.txt` as the suffix. For example, the expected output for `T.csv` can be found contained `T.txt`. These ```.txt``` files are contained in the provided ZIP file. (Reminder: You are not to create the `.txt` files yourself.)\n",
    "1. Use `try` and `except` when writing code that deals with the possibility of a non-existent file.\n",
    "1. ***You are permitted to `import` only the `math` modules into your solution.* That is, may *not* use `re`, `pandas`, `itertools`, etc.).**"
