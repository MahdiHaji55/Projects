    "\n",
    "In order to reduce confusion and errors as you prepare answers, for this assignment you are to use the rename operation (i.e. $\\rho$) in a notation similar to that used for $\\sigma$ and $\\pi$. For instance, the `Sells` relation described in the lectures has attributes `pub`, `beer`, and `price`. If we want to create a new relations `S'` where the attribute `pub` is now called `name`, you can write either:\n",
    "$$ S' = \\rho_{name, beer, price}(Sells) $$\n",
    "or:\n",
    "$$ S' = \\rho_{name / pub}(Sells)$$\n",

    "**1.** **Assumption:** To merge tuples from relations $R$ and $S$, they need compatible schemas with the same number and type of attributes. Also, as relations are set-like, neither $R$, $S$, nor their union will have duplicate tuples.\r\n",

    "\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**2.** **Assumption:** Both relations $R$ and $S$ must have compatible schemas, which entails having an identical number of attributes with corresponding attributes of the same data types. Additionally, it is assumed that each relation is a set and thus contains no duplicate tuples.\r\n",
    "\r\n",

Additionally, it is assumed that both relations are sets and therefore do not contain any duplicate tuples.\r\n",

Furthermore, the issue of duplicates within either $R$ or $S$ is irrelevant to the operation, as the Cartesian product focuses solely on combining each tuple from $R$ with each tuple from $S$, leading to a straightforward calculation of the size of the resulting relation based on the count of tuples in each original relation.\r\n",

    "There's no minimum or maximum in this case. The size of the relation resulting from $R$ X $S$ (the Cartesian product) is always $M$ X $N$ tuples, where $M$ is the number of tuples in $R$ and $N$ is the number of tuples in $S$.

This variability directly influences the size of the resulting relation, as it depends on the proportion of tuples in $R$ where the attribute a equals 5.)\r\n",

    "**6.** **Assumption:** It is crucial that the attribute a exists within the schema of the relation $R$. This operation is characterized by extracting values of the attribute a from all tuples in $R$. A key aspect of projection in relational algebra is the removal of duplicates, adhering to the principle that relations are treated as sets. Therefore, the resulting relation from $\\pi_a(R)$ will contain unique values of the attribute a, eliminating any duplicate occurrences of the same value.\r\n",

    "**7.** **Assumption:** The presence of at least one common attribute between relations $R$ and $S$ is essential, as the operation hinges on these shared attributes. The size of the resulting relation is heavily influenced by the distribution of values in these common attributes across both $R$ and $S$. This distribution determines how tuples from $R$ can be matched and joined with tuples from $S$, affecting the total number of tuples in the final joined relation.\r\n",

    "**1.** The key for the $Equities$ relation, given the functional dependencies {$S\\rightarrow D,I\\rightarrow B,IS\\rightarrow Q,B\\rightarrow O$}, is the combination ${I,S}$ (Investor and Security). This combination of attributes can uniquely determine every entry in the relation, thus qualifying as the minimal key.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**2.** **The given Functional Dependencies for the Equities relation form a minimal basis because they satisfy two key conditions:**\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**-** **No Redundancy:** Each Functional Dependency is necessary, none can be inferred from the others.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**-** **Minimized Left-hand Sides:** The attributes on the left side of each dependency are the fewest needed to uniquely determine the right side.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**3.** **To decompose the Equities relation into 3NF relations with 3NF synthesis algorithm, we'll follow these steps:**\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**-** **Start with the minimal basis:** \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The FDs for Equities(B, O, I, S, Q, D) are {$S\\rightarrow D,I\\rightarrow B,IS\\rightarrow Q,B\\rightarrow O$}. These are already a minimal basis.\r\n",

    "**-** **Create a relation for each FD in the minimal basis:**\r\n",

    "**-** **Ensure lossless-join:** The candidate key {$I,S$} is in Relation3, so the decomposition is lossless.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**-** **Check dependency preservation:** All FDs are represented in the relations, so it's dependency-preserving.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**-** **Verify BCNF:** In each relation, the left side of each FD is a key, so all relations are in BCNF.\r\n",
