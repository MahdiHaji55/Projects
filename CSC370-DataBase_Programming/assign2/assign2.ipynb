    "\r\n",
    "**Checking BNCF:** $A \\rightarrow B$ and $A \\rightarrow C$ comply with BNCF as $A$ is a superkey, also $BC \\rightarrow D$ does not comply since $BC$ is not a superkey from A is a candidate key.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**Decompostion:** Decompose $R$ into $R1(BCD)$ and $R2(ABC)$. $R1$ HANDLES $BC \\rightarrow D$, ensuring BCNF as $BC$ acts as a superkey there and $R2$ will key the rest, so it will still be in BCNF.\r\n",

    "**Checking loseless join:** Decomposition is loseless since $BC$, which is the common attribute set between $R1$ and $R2$, forms a candidate key is $R1$.\r\n",

    "**Checking BCNF:** All functional dependencies satisfy BCNF criteria since every attribute is part of a superkey due to the circular dependencies ($AB$ for $C$ and $D$, $C$ for $A$, $D$ for $B$).\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**Decomposition:** No decomposition is needed because $R$ already satisfies BCNF. Every FD's left side is a superkey or part of a superkey.\r\n",

    "**Checking lossless join:** Not applicable as $R$ was not decomposed; it inherently ensures a lossless join due to its structure.\r\n",

    "**Foreign Keys:** $Bookings$ will include foreign keys referencing the primary keys of $Customers$ and $Flights$ to enforce these relationships. The presence of a primary key in $Flights$ that includes both $Day$ and $Number$ suggests that flights are uniquely identified by a combination of the day they occur and their flight number. This composite key is carried over into the $Bookings$ entity as foreign keys to maintain referential integrity. Moreover, the $Bookings$ entity's dependency on $Customers$ and $Flights$ for its identification suggests a strong relational tie, necessitating careful management of foreign key constraints.\r\n",
